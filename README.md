# UI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

# Project Overview

This Angular project is a front-end application designed to interact with various APIs, handle data dynamically, and provide a user-friendly interface. It includes several components and services to manage data flow and user interactions. The project follows best practices in Angular development, including the use of reactive forms, data services, and component-based architecture.

## Key Features

Dynamic Data Handling: The application fetches data from APIs and displays it in a user-friendly manner. It includes functionalities to filter, search, and paginate through data.
Reactive Forms: The project utilizes Angular's reactive forms for better form handling and validation.
Responsive Design: The UI is designed to be responsive, ensuring compatibility with various screen sizes and devices.
Error Handling: Proper error handling mechanisms are in place to manage API call failures and display appropriate error messages to the user.
Session Storage: The application uses local storage to cache data, improving performance and reducing the need for repeated API calls.

## Development server

To run the project locally:

Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed.
Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
